  <p>It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French
    yeast-leavened laminated dough.[3] Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered
    with
    butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
    laminating.
    The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. <a
