    <p>Baked goods are foods made from dough or batter and cooked by baking,[1] a method of cooking food that uses
      prolonged
      dry heat, normally in an oven, but also in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread but
      many
      other types of foods are baked as well. One of these examples is a <strong>croissant</strong>. Click about on top
